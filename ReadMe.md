**PI**:Sara Contu & Gareth Thomas  
**Analyst**:Sara Contu  


This repo contains the models and analysis that compare the results from the first database paper and the new addition and changes made to the PREDICTS database since 2016.

This work is aimed at testing:
 - whether and in what measure the addition of over 1 million biodiverstiy measures contribute to estimates biodiversity indices with higher confidence
 - whether and in what measure the recuration of the sampling site to a more finely resolved land use classes classification (LUH2) contributes towards capturing biodiversity responses and processes at a finer scale.
