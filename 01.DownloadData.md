# 1 Source relevant data

This work is aimed at addressing:

“How much difference is made in model fit and projected BII by new data,
LUH2 recuration and taxon-level random effect?”

Old data vs old + new data LUH1 (mod1 \~ mod2) {2016 MODELS}

Old data vs old + new data LUH2 (mod3 \~ mod4) {2016 MODELS}

Old data vs old + new data LUH1 (mod5 \~ mod6) {2016 MODELS +
Taxon-fold}

Old data vs old + new data LUH2 (mod7 \~ mod8) {2016 MODELS +
Taxon-fold}

Below I list the data and sources of data necessary for this analysis.
N.B. This list will grow and change as i get more in the analysis.
please feel free to add to the list.

## 1.1 Database release 2016 with old LUH1

- Download and load PREDICTS 2016 release data (olddb hereafter) from
  the [NHM data portal 2016
  release](https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/the-2016-release-of-the-predicts-database).

``` r
  olddb <- readRDS("Data/database1strelease.rds")
```

## 1.2 Database release 2016 LUH2

- need to ask Andy/Adriana

## 1.3 Database release 2022 LUH1

-Download and load PREDICTS November 2022 release data (novdb hereafter)
from the [NHM data
portal](https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/release-of-data-added-to-the-predicts-database-november-2022)

``` r
  novdb <- readRDS("Data/database2ndrelease.rds")
```

## 1.4 Database release 2022 LUH2

- need to ask Andy/Adriana

## 1.5 (Database release 2016 with new LUH1 (some studies may have been recurated - so check for any diff))

- download the database extract from psql-predicts and filter for 2016
  database release sources to compare difference in LUH1 with the old
  version)

# 2 Explore the data - preparation for modelling

- source ID
- number of sites (SSBS)
- number of species (N.B. the number of species for the first release
  were calculated using the `CountSpecies` function in yarg. It uses the
  following Taxa resolved to species or infraspecies count once per
  taxon name Higher ranks count once per name per study)
- number and identities of countries (map?)
