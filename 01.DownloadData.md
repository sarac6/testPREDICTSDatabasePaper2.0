# 1 Source relevant data

This work is aimed at addressing:

“How much difference is made in model fit and projected BII by new data,
LUH2 recuration and taxon-level random effect?”

Old data vs old + new data LUH1 (mod1 \~ mod2) {2016 MODELS}

Old data vs old + new data LUH2 (mod3 \~ mod4) {2016 MODELS}

Old data vs old + new data LUH1 (mod5 \~ mod6) {2016 MODELS +
Taxon-fold}

Old data vs old + new data LUH2 (mod7 \~ mod8) {2016 MODELS +
Taxon-fold}

Below I list the data and sources of data necessary for this analysis.
N.B. This list will grow and change as i get more in the analysis.
please feel free to add to the list.

## 1.1 Database release 2016 with old LUH1

- Download and load PREDICTS 2016 release data (olddb hereafter) from
  the [NHM data portal 2016
  release](https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/the-2016-release-of-the-predicts-database).

``` r
  olddb <- readRDS("Data/database1strelease.rds")
```

## 1.2 Database release 2016 LUH2

- need to ask Andy/Adriana

## 1.3 Database release 2022 LUH1

-Download and load PREDICTS November 2022 release data (novdb hereafter)
from the [NHM data
portal](https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/release-of-data-added-to-the-predicts-database-november-2022)

``` r
  novdb <- readRDS("Data/database2ndrelease.rds")
```

## 1.4 Database release 2022 LUH2

- need to ask Andy/Adriana

## 1.5 (Database release 2016 with new LUH1 (some studies may have been recurated - so check for any diff))

- download the database extract from psql-predicts and filter for 2016
  database release sources to compare difference in LUH1 with the old
  version)

# 2 Explore the data - preparation for modelling

- source ID
- number of sites (SSBS)
- number of species (this is how species were counted for the first
  paper: How did you count 7,136 species? I make it 10,635 species. I
  used the `CountSpecies` function in yarg, which is what we used to
  count the number of species for the 2017 paper. It uses the following
  Taxa resolved to species or infraspecies count once per taxon name
  Higher ranks count once per name per study)
- number and identities of countries (map?)
